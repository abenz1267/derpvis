# Derpvis - not smart, still helpful

Derpvis is a little tool that literally just runs "git pull" on a bunch of folders you specified.

You can setup folders with a `DERPVIS_FOLDERS` envvar as well. Derpvis will add those folders to the list.

```
-c adds the current folder you are in
-a <folder> adds a given folder
-l lists all folders
-r <index> removes a given folder
```
